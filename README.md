## üìä Data Analysis with Pivot Tables

### 1. üöª Gender Distribution of Bike Buyers

| Gender | Avg Income (Non-Buyers) | Avg Income (Buyers) |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Female | 52,083                   | 56,667               |
| Male   | 50,000                   | 56,667               |

> ‚úÖ **Insight**: Both male and female bike buyers earn more than non-buyers. Gender alone doesn‚Äôt significantly affect purchase decisions.

---

### 2. üí∞ Impact of Income on Bike Purchases

- **Buyers Average Income**: 56,667  
- **Non-Buyers Average Income**: 50,893

> ‚úÖ **Insight**: Higher income strongly correlates with likelihood of purchasing a bike.

### 3. üß≠ Commute Distance vs Bike Buyers

| Commute Distance | Buyers | Non-Buyers |
|------------------|--------|------------|
| 0‚Äì1 Miles        | 6      | 8          |
| 1‚Äì2 Miles        | 11     | 12         |
| 2‚Äì5 Miles        | 6      | 7          |
| 5‚Äì10 Miles       | 14     | 20         |
| >10 Miles        | 5      | 9          |

> ‚úÖ **Insight**: People who commute **5‚Äì10 miles** are the most frequent bike buyers. Longer commutes reduce purchase probability.

---

### 4. üë• Age Groups & Purchase Behavior

| Age Group  | Buyers | Non-Buyers |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Adolescent | 4      | 1          |
| Middle Age | 32     | 41         |
| Old        | 6      | 14         |

> ‚úÖ **Insight**: Middle-aged customers dominate the dataset, but adolescents have the **highest bike purchase percentage** (80%).

- **Age**: Middle-aged
